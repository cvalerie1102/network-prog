# network-prog

This project implements a client-server UDP application where the client sends 10 `PING` messages, and the server responds with `PONG` 70% of the time.

## How to Run

1. Start the server:
   make sure it's in the same directory as the file
   then run python server.py 8008


2. python client.py
   make sure it's in the same directory as the file
   then run python client.py local host 8008
